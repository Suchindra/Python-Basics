    "Clue1: First think how you swap the values of two variables. Imagine you have 2 numbers number1 and number2. Let number1=10 and number2=20. Now try swapping the values. That is after swapping, number1 should have 20 and number2 should have 10. This Simple Idea should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clue2: You can use very simple approach. Start with the very first position, ensure that it has the least value. How you do this? (a) compare its value with 2nd, and if it is greater, just 'swap' it (b) compare again its value with 3rd postion, and it is greater, just swap it. Do the same thing (a) and (b) for the 2nd postion. Automatically 3rd position will be correct. So, you just have to SWAP only 3 times AT MOST.\n"
